AWS Security Best Practices
----------------------------------
1. Make sure to understand "AWS Shared Responsibility Model"
	Amazon resp: Amazon is responsible for the security of the software, hardware, and the physical facilities that host AWS services. Amazon also takes responsibility for the security configuration of its managed services such as Amazon DynamoDB, RDS, Redshift, Elastic MapReduce, WorkSpaces, etc.

	Customer Resp:  AWS customers are responsible for secure usage of AWS services that are considered unmanaged. 

2. Tighten CloudTrail Configuration
	Enable cloudtrail across all regions.
	Turn on log file validation in S3 buckets
	Enable access logging
	Turn on MFA on CLoudtrail S3 bucket and encrypt logfiles.

3. Follow IAM best practices
	Make sure IAM policies are always attached to group or role than IAM user itself.
	Make use of IAM roles whereever possible
	Ensure IAM users are given minimal access
	Ensure IAM users have MFA on account
	Limit number of admin users
	Set up password regulation for strong password
