	Types
		General Purpose SSD (GP2)
			balanced between price and performance
			3 IOPS per GB (min 100 IOPS and upto 10000 IOPS) extra Burst for 3000 IOPS for Volume under 1 GB
		Provisioned IOPS
			Designed for I/O intesive applications (RDB / NoSQL DB)
			IOPS Provision upto 20000
		Magnatic Storage (SATA HDD)
			Throughout Optimized
			Used for Large amount of sequencial data
			Data Warehouse / Big Data
			Not a Boot Volume
		Cold HDD (ST1)
			Lowest Storage for Infrequently Access Storage such as File Server
			Not a Boot Volume
		Magnatic Standard
			Lowest Cost Magnatic that can be bootable

Logging into EC2 Instance
			yum update -y
			yum install httpd -y

Status Check
		System Status Check
			Issue with the Infrastruture unline Hypervisor
		Instance Status Check
			Issue with OS, Configuration

EC2 Basic CloudWatch Monitoring

Security Group
		Virtual Firewall for Instances
		All Inbound Traffic is blocked by default
		All Outbound Traffic is allowed
		Changes take effect immediately
		One EC2 can have any number of Security Groups
		One Security Group can be attached to Multiple EC2 instances
		Stateful
		Cant block specific IP address using SG
		Only Allow rules. No Deny rules

Volumes and Snapshop
		Specifc to AZ. Make sure to keep Volume and EC2 in same AZ
		lsblk
		file -s /dev/xvdf
		Volumes and Image can be created from snapshots. Even storage type can be changed
		Volumes exist on EBS
		Snapshots are point in time copy of volume		
		Snapshots exist on S3
		Snapshots are incremental

RAID
		Redundant Arrary of Independent Disks
		Collection of disks working as Single Disk
		RAID-0 -> Striped / No Redundency Good Performance
		RAID-1 -> Mirrored, Redundency
		RAID-5 -> Atleast 3 Disks needed. Good for Read. Bad for Write, Amazon does not recommend RADI-5
		RADI-10 -> Combination of RAID-1 and RAID-0, Striping and Mirroring, Redundant, Good Performance 
		Used when Disk I/O is not enough
		Create RAID Disk on Windows

		Snapshot of RAID
			Default snapshot in RAID volumes does not take snap of Cache and OS
			Use Application Consistence Snaps
				Stop App or other programs writing to Disk
				Flush full cache to disk
			How to Do
				Freez the File System
				Unmount RAID array
				Shutdown EC2 Instance
	
AMI EBS vs Instance Store
		
		Instance Store (Ephemeral Storage)
			Cant Attach after Instance is launched
			Can be rebooted and Can not be stopped. If Underlying host fails, user losses its data
			Less Durability
			Instance Store cant be dettached and attached to other EC2
			Root device is always from template stored in S3
		EBS 		
		

Placement Groups: These are used to place instances near to each other or far from each other based on what policy you select. CLuster and Spread Policy.

	Instances within same AZ
	Low Latency between instances. 10 GBPS
	Cant Span multiple AZ
	Only Specific Types of Instances can be launched in Placement Groups
	AWS recommends homogeneous instances
	Cant merge Placement group
	Cant move existing instance into placement group
